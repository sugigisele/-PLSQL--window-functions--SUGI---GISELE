Step 1: Problem Definition

Business Context

Company Type: Global e-commerce retailer

Department: Sales Analytics

Industry: Retail

Data Challenge

The company has no visibility in its performance of individual regional sales or customer purchase behavior, which leads to low inventory allocation and generic marketing strategies. Sale data is dispersed and it's impossible to pinpoint best-selling products as well as endangered customer groups.

Expected Outcome

Determine best-sellers by region/quarter, track sales trends via a moving average and separate clients by how frequently they make purchases to build targeted marketing initiatives and increase revenues 12% in the fiscal year ahead.
